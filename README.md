Timer
=====

What
----

I needed a simple timer for holding lightning talks, so I built one. You can see a demo of it at [http://hackandtell.org/timer](http://hackandtell.org/timer).

Who
---

Andrew Gwozdziewycz originally made this for [http://hackandtell.org](Hack and Tell)

Usage
-----

Just dump all the files in a directory and load up `index.html` in your browser. If you append `#10` to the url, you'll get a 10 minute timer. It defaults to 5.

Double click on the time resets it. Single click pauses/unpauses.
